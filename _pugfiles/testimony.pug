        | to help me rent better and faster all my properties. We use the home staging light and every time, <b> it is a win.</b>
        | I rent within less than a month and <b> 20% more</b>
        | expensive than the expected price. The work is serious, with a good quality and always surprising decoration. I would definitely recommend this company which has reasonable prices and which can act very quickly."

      p "After having my home on the market last year for a few months and without any offers 
        | I had decided to lower the price starting January but a friend suggested to do a nice staging before discounting the property.  
        | After doing some research I came across <b>EZ Home Staging</b> which were very well priced compared to other companies 
        | I looked into so I signed up for a month of staging, they were <b>very easy</b> to deal with and made the experience smooth... 
        | All I can say is that they are very good at what they do, they made my place looked so much better and presentable after 
        | everything was set and done but the best part was I got 2 offers within 2 weeks so I took the cash offer and the deal was done... 
        | <b>Best money I ever spent...</b>"
